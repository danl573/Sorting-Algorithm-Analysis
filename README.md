Sorting is a C++ project that empirically verifies the upper bound
of various sorting algorithms, as well as gather performance data
on algorithms in the same Big-O class.

## Installation 

This project can be run in the commandline via g++, or by compiling in CLion using the CMakeLists.txt file with your chosen compiler. Below I will show you how to install g++.

First, check if g++ is installed.
```text

```
If it is not installed, install it.
```text
